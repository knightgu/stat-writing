# How to Write Specific Sections


## Title

Title is the most read part of an article. @hariston2003successful suggest that
the title of a research paper should accomplish four goals:

+ predict the content of the research paper;
+ be interesting to the reader;
+ reflect the tone of the writing;
+ contain important keywords (that makes it easier to be found from keywords
  search).
  
The title of a paper is usually determined when the paper is close to
completion. To come up with a good title, list some key phrases that you would
like to have, and be creative in forming a good title consisting most of them.
Here are some tipcs.

+ Be informative by including these aspects: topic, method(s), data, and
  results.
+ Consider adding a subtitle to give more specifics about the paper.
+ Use appropriate critical keywords to increase the discoverability of the
  paper.
+ Follow the requirements from the instructors or journals.
+ Keep it as concise as possible.

## Keywords
Keywords are words in addition to those in the title that attract search
queries. Including the most relevant keywords helps other researchers find
your paper.


+ No need to repeat anything in the title already. 
+ List them in alphabetical order.
+ Contain words and phrases that suggest what the topic is about. 

## Introduction

The introduction section is always the first section of a paper. Some journals
may not call it introduction but requires a section that serves the same
purposes. The introduction section guide the readers from a general subject area
to the narrow topic of the paper. It should answer three questions:

+ Why does it matter?
+ What have been done?
+ What are new?

That is, the introduction sections need to explain the impotance of the topic of
the paper, provide the background of the research work, and highlight the
contributions of the work. At the end of the introduction, a roadmap, or an
outline of the paper is useful in helping the readers navigating through the
following sections.

An introduction often contain the following items.

+ An overview of the topic. Start with a general overview of your topic and
  narrow it to the specific subject you are addressing. Then, mention
  questions or concerns you had about the case. Explain why they are important
  and needs to be addressed right now.
+ Existing works. Introduction is the place to review other conclusions on your
  topic. The literature review should be thorough, including both old and recent
  ones. It should you that you are aware of prior research. It also introduces
  past findings to those who might not have that expertise. A gap need to be
  identified from the importance of the topic and the current status of the
  literature, which is the rationale for your work.
+ Contributions. This is a thesis statement, which summarizes the the
  contributions of your work to the existing literature, and answer the "what
  are new" question.
+ A roadmap. A brief summary of what each section does in the paper concludes
  the introduction.

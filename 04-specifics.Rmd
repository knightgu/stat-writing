# Writing Specific Sections

## Title

Title is the most read part of an article. @hairston2003successful suggest that
the title of a research paper should accomplish four goals:

+ predict the content of the research paper;
+ be interesting to the reader;
+ reflect the tone of the writing;
+ contain important keywords (that makes it easier to be found from keywords
  search).
  
The title of a paper is usually determined when the paper is close to
completion. To come up with a good title, list some key phrases that you would
like to have, and be creative in forming a good title consisting most of them.
Here are some tipcs.

+ Be informative by including these aspects: topic, method(s), data, and
  results.
+ Consider adding a subtitle to give more specifics about the paper.
+ Use appropriate critical keywords to increase the discoverability of the
  paper.
+ Follow the requirements from the instructions or journals.
+ Keep it as concise as possible.

## Abstract

@marron1999effective recommended the following:

> Abstract material needs to be carefully chosen. A balance between the
> twin goals of brevity and maximal information content should again be
> carefully sought. There is room for more detail than in the title, but not
> enough room for all ideas covered in the paper. Make sure each ``high point"
> is included. The paper will have a better chance in the review process if it
> is made clear what is done, and why it is important, since this will
> immediately capture the interest of the reviewer.

>     Any recommendations for length here must be more case dependent. Longer
> papers will usually need longer abstracts. However, something between 4
> and 10 sentences is reasonable for most situations.

>     Mathematical notation is rarely useful in the abstract. Sometimes notation is
> introduced in an abstract, and then not used at all! Even when notation is
> used in the abstract, the point can usually be conveyed more efficienly in
> words alone.

Tips:
+ An opening sentence to establish the importance of the subject of the paper.
+ Identify a gap in the literature to set up the background of the paper.
+ Highlight the novelty/contributions of the paper.
+ For application papers, allude to new discoveries and their impacts.
+ For method papers, outline the essence of the methodology, evidence from
  numerical studies supporting the methods.

## Keywords
Keywords are words in addition to those in the title that attract search
queries. Including the most relevant keywords helps other researchers find
your paper.


+ No need to repeat anything in the title already. 
+ List them in alphabetical order.
+ Contain words and phrases that suggest what the topic is about. 

## Introduction

The introduction section is always the first section of a paper. Some journals
may not call it introduction but requires a section that serves the same
purposes. The introduction section guide the readers from a general subject area
to the narrow topic of the paper. It should answer three questions:

+ Why does it matter?
+ What have been done?
+ What are new?

That is, the introduction sections need to explain the impotance of the topic of
the paper, provide the background of the research work, and highlight the
contributions of the work. At the end of the introduction, a roadmap, or an
outline of the paper is useful in helping the readers navigating through the
following sections.

An introduction often contain the following items.

+ An overview of the topic. Start with a general overview of your topic and
  narrow it to the specific subject you are addressing. Then, mention
  questions or concerns you had about the case. Explain why they are important
  and needs to be addressed right now.
+ Existing works. Introduction is the place to review other conclusions on your
  topic. The literature review should be thorough, including both old and recent
  ones. It should you that you are aware of prior research. It also introduces
  past findings to those who might not have that expertise. A gap need to be
  identified from the importance of the topic and the current status of the
  literature, which is the rationale for your work.
+ Contributions. This is a thesis statement, which summarizes the the
  contributions of your work to the existing literature, and answer the "what
  are new" question.
+ A roadmap. A brief summary of what each section does in the paper concludes
  the introduction.
  

## Data

The data section should provide all the details that are relevant for the
research project.

+ Who collected the data (source)?
+ How was the data collected? Sampling frame? Sampling approach?
+ What period or range does the data cover?
+ Why does the data helps answer the research question?
+ What exploratory analyses are done (descriptives, visualication, etc.)?


## Methods

Notations are much easier to digest if the reader first understands the main
idea at an intuitive level.

+ What are the observed data?
+ What are the models?
+ What are the parameters to be estimated?
+ How are the point estimators obtained?
+ How are the uncertainty (standard errors) of the point estimators assessed?
+ How are the variance of the point estimator estimated?
+ How are the null distribution of the testing statistics established?
+ Clearly state the assumptions and claims of theoretical results.

## Simulation

ADEMP [@morris2019using]:

+ Aims
+ Data generating mechanism
+ Estimand/target of analysis
+ Methods
+ Performance measures

Coding and Execution

Analysis/Discussion: with tables and figures.
+ For each table/figure, write down the bullet points to convey to the readers.
+ Group the bulletin points in blocks and put the blocks in a logical order.
+ Within each block, put the bullet points in the right logical order.

## Application

+ Report the statistical analyses in tables/figures.
+ When summarizing from tables/figures, paint the big picture, rather than
  reiterating all of the little details.
+ Discussions to link the analyses back to the substantive topic [@miller2006how]:
> Having presented the individual pieces of evidence, an investigator must
> summarize how that evidence, taken together, support the conclusoin of the
> investigation. Statisticians should explain how the statistical evidence answers
> the question posed at the beginning of the paper, following standard
> expository writing guidelines to writing an analytic essay.


## Discussion

+ A summary, again, of the contributions of the research. 
+ Limitations of the current study
+ Future directions.

## Appendix

+ Technical details (e.g., proofs, algorithms) that would otherwise break the
  flow of the main text.
+ Data source details.

## References

+ Every reference cited in the paper should appear here.
+ References not cited should not appear here.
+ All are automatically taken care of by BibTeX.
+ Styles are controlled by bib style (`.bst` file).

## Online Supplement

+ Computer code
+ Data
+ Additional simulation results

# Writing Specific Sections

## Title

The title is the most read part of an article, and influences whether a reader 
is interested in reading the manuscript.
@hairston2003successful suggest 
that
the title of a research paper should accomplish four goals:

+ predict the content of the research paper;
+ be interesting to the reader;
+ reflect the tone of the writing;
+ contain important keywords (that makes it easier to be found from keywords
  search).
  
The title of a paper is usually determined when the paper is close to
completion. To come up with a good title, list some key phrases that you would
like to have, and be creative in forming a good title that consists of most of 
them. Here are some tips.

+ Be informative by including these aspects: topic, method(s), data, and
  results.
+ Consider adding a subtitle to give more specifics about the paper.
+ Use appropriate critical keywords to increase the discoverability of the
  paper.
+ Follow the requirements from the instructions or journals.
+ Keep it as concise as possible.

## Abstract

@marron1999effective recommended the following:

> Abstract material needs to be carefully chosen. A balance between the
> twin goals of brevity and maximal information content should again be
> carefully sought. There is room for more detail than in the title, but not
> enough room for all ideas covered in the paper. Make sure each "high point"
> is included. The paper will have a better chance in the review process if it
> is made clear what is done, and why it is important, since this will
> immediately capture the interest of the reviewer.

> Any recommendations for length here must be more case dependent. Longer
> papers will usually need longer abstracts. However, something between 4
> and 10 sentences is reasonable for most situations.

> Mathematical notation is rarely useful in the abstract. Sometimes notation is
> introduced in an abstract, and then not used at all! Even when notation is
> used in the abstract, the point can usually be conveyed more efficiently in
> words alone.

Tips:

+ Open with a sentence to establish the importance of the subject of the paper.
+ Identify a gap in the literature to set up the background of the paper.
+ Highlight the novelty/contributions of the paper.
+ For application papers, allude to new discoveries and their impacts.
+ For method papers, outline the essence of the methodology, and evidence from
  theoretical and numerical studies supporting the methods.
+ It must make sense when read in isolation for those who only read the 
  abstract, and must also provide a clear and accurate summary of the manuscript
  for readers who read the entire manuscript [@zeiger2000writing].  
+ Should not include citations.

## Keywords
Keywords are words in addition to those in the title that attract search
queries. Including the most relevant keywords helps other researchers find
your paper.


+ No need to repeat anything in the title already. 
+ List them in alphabetical order.
+ Contain words and phrases that suggest what the topic is about. 

## Introduction

The introduction section is always the first section of a paper. Some journals
may not call it introduction but require a section that serves the same
purpose. The purpose of the introduction is to stimulate the readerâ€™s interest 
and to provide background information which is pertinent to the study 
[@jenkins1995write]. The introduction section guides the readers from a general 
subject 
area to the narrow topic of the paper. It should answer three questions:

+ Why does it matter?
+ What has already been done?
+ What is new?

That is, the introduction sections need to explain the importance of the topic 
of
the paper, provide the background of the research work, and highlight the
contributions of the work. At the end of the introduction, a roadmap, or an
outline of the paper is useful in helping the readers navigate through the
following sections.

The introduction is typically outlined at the very beginning of the writing
process, but completed towards the end after the other sections have been 
written.   Do NOT wait to perform the literature review until 
last, however!  This should happen *before* the research is undertaken to
ensure you are not duplicating something that has already been done!

An introduction often contains the following items.

+ An overview of the topic. Start with a general overview of your topic and
  narrow it to the specific subject you are addressing. Then, mention
  questions or concerns you have about the case. Explain why they are important
  and why it needs to be addressed right now.
+ Existing works. The introduction is the place to review other conclusions on 
  your
  topic. The literature review should be thorough, including both old and recent
  works. It should show that you are aware of prior research. It also introduces
  past findings to those who might not have that expertise. 
+ A gap needs to be
  identified from the importance of the topic and the current status of the
  literature, which is the rationale for your work. Why are existing methods not
  sufficient?  What are elements of an attractive solution?
+ Contributions. This is a thesis statement, which summarizes the the
  contributions of your work to the existing literature, and answers the "what
  is new" question.
+ A roadmap. A brief summary of what each section does in the paper. This 
  concludes the introduction.
  

## Data

The data section should provide all the details that are relevant for the
research project.

+ Who collected the data (source)?
+ How was the data collected? Sampling frame? Sampling approach?
+ What period or range does the data cover?
+ Why does the data help answer the research question?
+ What exploratory analyses are done (descriptives, visualization, etc.)?


## Methods

Notation is much easier to digest if the reader first understands the main
idea at an intuitive level.

+ Establish notation.
+ What are the observed data?
+ What are the models?
+ What are the parameters to be estimated?
+ How are the point estimators obtained?
+ How are the uncertainty (standard errors) of the point estimators assessed?
+ How are the variances of the point estimators estimated?
+ How are the null distribution of the testing statistics established?
+ Clearly state the assumptions and claims of theoretical results.

## Simulation

ADEMP [@morris2019using]:

+ Aims
+ Data generating mechanism
+ Estimand/target of analysis
+ Methods
+ Performance measures

Coding and Execution

Analysis/Discussion: with tables and figures.  May be included in a Results 
section.

+ For each table/figure, write down the bullet points to convey to the readers.
+ Group the bullet points in blocks and put the blocks in a logical order.
+ Within each block, put the bullet points in the right logical order.
+ Some (shorter) blocks can be converted into proper paragraphs in the final 
  paper, while other (longer) blocks may remain in bullet form.

## Application

+ Report the statistical analyses in tables/figures.
+ When summarizing from tables/figures, paint the big picture, rather than
  reiterating all of the little details.
+ Discussions to link the analyses back to the substantive topic
  [@miller2015chicago]:
  
> Having presented the individual pieces of evidence, an investigator must
> summarize how that evidence, taken together, support the conclusoin of the
> investigation. Statisticians should explain how the statistical evidence answers
> the question posed at the beginning of the paper, following standard
> expository writing guidelines to writing an analytic essay.


## Discussion and Conclusion

+ A summary, again, of the contributions of the research. 
+ The research question posed as the `need' of the introduction must be
  answered here [@zeiger2000writing].
+ Limitations of the current study
+ Future directions.

## Appendix

+ Technical details (e.g., proofs, algorithms) that would otherwise break the
  flow of the main text.
+ Data source details.

## Acknowledgements

This section is optional, but could be used to acknowledge certain individuals
who have contributed to the research and/or success of the manuscript (e.g.
peer reviewers).  

In general, if the research upon which you are writing was funded, the funding
agency and funding mechanism are typically included here unless otherwise 
specified.  

## References

+ Every reference cited in the paper should appear here.
+ References not cited should not appear here.
+ All are automatically taken care of by BibTeX.
+ Styles are controlled by bib style (`.bst` file).

## Online Supplement

+ Computer code
+ Data
+ Additional simulation results

## General Tips

From @jenkins1995write:

> In order to maintain continuity between the key sections (introduction, 
> methods, results and discussion) it is helpful to consider the manuscript as
> telling a story. 
>
> The strong parts to the story-line are the introduction and the discussion, so
> the link between these sections must be clear.  

Devices such as paragraphing, headings, indentation, and enumeration
help the reader see the major points that you want to make.

As a rule of thumb, if you type a full page (double spaced) without
indenting for a new paragraph, you almost certainly have run one thought
into another and have missed an opportunity to differentiate your ideas.

Any tables and figures included in the manuscript must be mentioned (referenced)
within the main text.

If journal/instructions do not specify otherwise, tables and figures should be
placed near (ideally after) the related text, and on the top of the page. 

Use consistent notation throughout the manuscript, avoid defining any 
unnecessary notation, and avoid using the same notation to describe different
things (variables, indices, etc.).  

## General Tips: Use of English

It is relatively easy to read and understand English which is well written. 
As the quality of writing deteriorates, however, it becomes progressively more 
difficult for the reader to understand the author's intended meaning. 

An obvious problem occurs when the author fails to use properly constructed 
sentences. This can be easily corrected with revision and external review.

A much more dangerous problem occurs when the author unconsciously assumes that 
the reader is able to follow his/her unwritten train of thought.  This can 
also usually be caught with external review.

More tips on the use of English:

+ Use of tenses: Use present tense for most of the manuscript; use past tense 
only when describing events that occurred in the past (data collection, an 
experiment that has already been conducted, how simulations were designed).  
Be consistent with tense usage within sections, paragraphs, etc.

+ Do not use the word 'significant' other than in a statistical sense.

+ The word 'data' is often mistakenly treated as if it were a singular noun
instead of as a plural noun.  The word 'data' is, in fact, a plural noun (its 
singular form is 'datum').

# Review a Paper

Reviewing is the other side of the same coin as writing. It is an important
skill and service for the scientific community. A good writer anticipates
comments from possible reviewers and address them in writing. A critical review
helps make an manuscript much stronger.


In this writing course, we are writing statistical projects. Here is a check
list adapted from <https://www.science.org/content/article/how-review-paper>.

+ Are the background literature and study rationale clearly articulated?
+ Do the hypotheses follow logically from previous work?
+ Are the methods robust and well controlled?
+ Are the reported analyses appropriate? 
+ Are the assumptions of the statistical methods satisfied?
+ Is the presentation of results clear and accessible? 
+ To what extent does the Discussion place the findings in a wider context and
  achieve a balance between interpretation and useful speculation versus tedious
  waffling?


To write a reviewer's report, here is a template.

+ A summary of the what the paper is about and how you feel about its solidity.
+ List the major concerns in detail about the paper eluded in the summary.
+ Go through the specific points that are not clearly presented or need to be
  improved, in the order they appeared in the paper.
+ Finally, a list of really minor stuff (misprints, notation abuse, etc.).


Tips:

+ Be as constructive as possible.
+ Avoid rude or disparaging remarks.
+ Back up major criticisms.
+ Make the review useful for the editor as well as for the authors.

# Getting Started

## Full Cycle of a Statistical Research Project
Like any research project, a statistical research project starts with an
interesting idea, goes through a full cycle of brainstorming, planning with the
right design/methods, investigation with the simulation studies/data analyses,
iteration as nesessary, and summarizing through writing/revision.


1. Find a topic of interest. The topic should interests you, something about
   which you already know something about or can find out more. The topic should
   also be something that is within your capacity restricted by your skillsets
   and time. Check the literature to see what works have been available on it or
   related topics. In short, the topic should be reasonably interesting and
   doable. You can get ideas for research by 
    + attending siminars;
    + reading journals, books, magazines, and newspapers;
    + consulting;
    + collaboration.
1. Initial planning. After you have identified an topic, you need to narrow down
   on the specific research questions that you want to answer, what data will be
   used, and what methods are appropriate.
    + Form a hypothesis, design a study, conduct the study, make notes.
    + Collect data and find some existing data.
    + Decide on appropriate statistical methods.
    + Make a tentative outline to guide writing.
1. Statistical investigation. 
    + Perform data analysis.
    + Summarize substantive findings.
    + Investigate the performance of proposed methods via simulations.
1. Iterate between planning and investigation.
1. Revise and proofread. Revising and writing are two separate processes.
    + Check organization --- reorganize paragraphs and add transitions where necessary.
    + Make sure all researched information is documented (reproducibility).
    + Rework introduction and conclusion.
    + Work on sentences --- check spelling, punctuation, word choice, etc.
    + Read out loud to check for flow.
    + Find a friend to review.


## Writing a Research Proposal

A research proposal is piece of writing that details exactly what you plan to do
in a research project.


The following components are expected in your proposal.
+ Introduction: Introducing the topic and why you have chosen this topic (3--5
  lines). Mention briefly the current related research and cite relevant works.
+ Specific aims: Formulate a research question or hypothesis in the
  chosen topic. Describe briefly why you select such a question or hypothesis
  and its importance in the field (cite sources).
+ Data description: Describe your data set (for instance: sampling scheme,
  number of observations, number of variables, variables of interest, nature of
  the variables) and the source of your data set if it is not collected by
  yourself.
+ Research design/methods/schedule: 
  Describe briefly (5-7 lines) your plan of action. If you
  choose to apply any specific statistical methods, please mention and cite
  them. Please be consistent here with your research hypothesis. Write a line
  regarding how the methods would help in investigating the research hypothesis.
+ Discussion: What do you expect to find and why
  do you feel so? Any ways your work can corroborate or challenge existing
  results or assumptions? What are the potential impacts of your work? What if
  the investigation is not what you expect?
+ Conclusion: Wrap it up by briefly summarizing your research proposal and
  reinforces your researchâ€™s stated purpose.

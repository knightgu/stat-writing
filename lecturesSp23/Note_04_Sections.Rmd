# Title, Abstract, Keywords

## Title

The title is the most read part of an article, and influences whether a reader 
is interested in reading the manuscript.

@hairston2003successful suggest 
that the title of a research paper should accomplish four goals:

+ predict the content of the research paper;
+ be interesting to the reader;
+ reflect the tone of the writing;
+ contain important keywords (that makes it easier to be found from keywords
  search).
  
---

The title of a paper is usually determined when the paper is close to
completion. 

To come up with a good title, list some key phrases that you would
like to have, and be creative in forming a good title that consists of most of 
them. Here are some tips:

+ Be informative by including these aspects: topic, method(s), data, and
  results.
+ Consider adding a subtitle to give more specifics about the paper.
+ Use appropriate critical keywords to increase the discoverability of the
  paper.
+ Follow the requirements from the instructions or journals.
+ Keep it as concise as possible.


## Abstract

@marron1999effective recommended the following:

\small 
> Abstract material needs to be carefully chosen. A balance between the
> twin goals of brevity and maximal information content should again be
> carefully sought. There is room for more detail than in the title, but not
> enough room for all ideas covered in the paper. Make sure each ``high point"
> is included. The paper will have a better chance in the review process if it
> is made clear what is done, and why it is important, since this will
> immediately capture the interest of the reviewer.

> Any recommendations for length here must be more case dependent. Longer
> papers will usually need longer abstracts. However, something between 4
> and 10 sentences is reasonable for most situations.

> Mathematical notation is rarely useful in the abstract. Sometimes notation is
> introduced in an abstract, and then not used at all! Even when notation is
> used in the abstract, the point can usually be conveyed more efficiently in
> words alone.

Tips:

+ Open with a sentence to establish the importance of the subject of the paper.
+ Identify a gap in the literature to set up the background of the paper.
+ Highlight the novelty/contributions of the paper.
+ For application papers, allude to new discoveries and their impacts.
+ For method papers, outline the essence of the methodology, and evidence from
  theoretical and numerical studies supporting the methods.
+ Write this section towards the end of the writing process, after you have 
  completed most of the other sections.
+ It must make sense when read in isolation for those who only read the 
  abstract, and must also provide a clear and accurate summary of the manuscript
  for readers who read the entire manuscript [@zeiger2000writing].  
+ Should not include citations.

## Keywords

Keywords are words in addition to those in the title that attract search
queries. 

Including the most relevant keywords helps other researchers find
your paper.

+ No need to repeat anything in the title already. 
+ List them in alphabetical order.
+ Contain words and phrases that suggest what the topic is about. 

# Introduction

## Introduction

The introduction section is always the first section of a paper. 

Some journals
may not call it introduction but require a section that serves the same
purpose. 

The purpose of the introduction is to stimulate the readerâ€™s interest and to provide background information which is pertinent to the study [@jenkins1995write].

The introduction section guides the readers from a general subject 
area to the narrow topic of the paper. It should answer three questions:

+ Why does it matter?
+ What has already been done?
+ What is new?

---

That is, the introduction sections need to explain the importance of the topic 
of
the paper, provide the background of the research work, and highlight the
contributions of the work. 

At the end of the introduction, a roadmap, or an
outline of the paper is useful in helping the readers navigate through the
following sections.

The introduction is typically outlined at the very beginning of the writing
process, but completed towards the end after the other sections have been 
written. 

Do NOT wait until the end to perform the literature review, 
however!  This should happen *before* the research is undertaken to ensure 
you are not duplicating something that has already been done!

---

An introduction often contains the following items.

+ An overview of the topic. Start with a general overview of your topic and
  narrow it to the specific subject you are addressing. Then, mention
  questions or concerns you had about the case. Explain why they are important
  and why it needs to be addressed right now.
+ Existing works. The introduction is the place to review other conclusions on 
  your
  topic. The literature review should be thorough, including both old and recent
  works. It should show that you are aware of prior research. It also introduces
  past findings to those who might not have that expertise. 
+ A gap needs to be
  identified from the importance of the topic and the current status of the
  literature, which is the rationale for your work. Why are existing methods not   sufficient?  What are elements of an attractive solution?
  
--- 

+ Contributions. This is a thesis statement, which summarizes the the
  contributions of your work to the existing literature, and answers the "what
  is new" question.
+ A roadmap. A brief summary of what each section does in the paper. This 
  concludes the introduction.
  

# Data and Methods

## Data

The data section should provide all the details that are relevant for the
research project.

+ Who collected the data (source)?
+ How was the data collected? Sampling frame? Sampling approach?
+ What period or range does the data cover?
+ Why does the data help answer the research question?
+ What exploratory analyses are done (descriptives, visualization, etc.)?


## Methods

This is the section often written first.  Here we establish notation and 
attempt to answer the following questions where applicable:

+ What are the observed data?
+ What are the models?
+ What are the parameters to be estimated?
+ How are the point estimators obtained?
+ How are the uncertainty (standard errors) of the point estimators assessed?
+ How are the variances of the point estimators estimated?
+ How are the null distribution of the testing statistics established?
+ What are the assumptions of the methods? 
+ What are the claims of theoretical results?

# Simulation and Application

## Simulation

A simulation section, if needed, should include the following:

ADEMP [@morris2019using]:

+ Aims
+ Data generating mechanism
+ Estimand/target of analysis
+ Methods
+ Performance measures

Coding and Execution

Analysis/Discussion: with tables and figures.  May be included in a Results 
section.

---

Tips:

+ For each table/figure, write down the bullet points to convey to the readers.
+ Group the bullet points in blocks and put the blocks in a logical order.
+ Within each block, put the bullet points in the right logical order.
+ Some (shorter) blocks can be converted into proper paragraphs in the final 
  paper, while other (longer) blocks may remain in bullet form.

## Application

+ Remember to check assumptions where possible.
+ Report the statistical analyses in tables/figures.
+ When summarizing from tables/figures, paint the big picture, rather than
  reiterating all of the little details.
+ Discussions to link the analyses back to the substantive topic
  [@miller2015chicago]:

>  
> Having presented the individual pieces of evidence, an investigator must
> summarize how that evidence, taken together, support the conclusion of the
> investigation. Statisticians should explain how the statistical evidence answers
> the question posed at the beginning of the paper, following standard
> expository writing guidelines to writing an analytic essay.


# Discussion and Conclusion

## Discussion and Conclusion

This discussion section is usually written last, and includes:

+ A summary, again, of the contributions of the research. 
+ The research question posed as the `need' of the introduction must be
  answered here [@zeiger2000writing].
+ Limitations of the current study.
+ Future directions.


# Acknowledgements and References

## Acknowledgements

This section is optional, but could be used to acknowledge certain individuals
who have contributed to the research and/or success of the manuscript (e.g.,
peer reviewers).  

In general, if the research upon which you are writing was funded, the funding
agency and funding mechanism are typically included here unless otherwise 
specified.  

## References

See Note 2, but as a reminder:

+ Every reference cited in the paper should appear here.
+ References not cited should not appear here.
+ All are automatically taken care of by BibTeX.
+ Styles are controlled by bib style (`.bst` file).


# Appendix and Online Supplement

## Appendix

Here we include:

+ Technical details (e.g., proofs, algorithms) that would otherwise break  the
  flow of the main text.
+ Data source details.
+ If these are too lengthy, they may be instead relegated to an online 
  supplement.

## Online Supplement

If code and data are not provided through link to github, R package, etc., in the main paper, an online supplement often includes

+ computer code for reproducibility, 
+ data for reproducibility, and also
+ additional simulation results and technical details.

# General Writing Tips

## General Writing Tips

From @jenkins1995write:

> In order to maintain continuity between the key sections (introduction, 
> methods, results and discussion) it is helpful to consider the manuscript as
> telling a story. 
>
> The strong parts to the story-line are the introduction and the discussion, so
> the link between these sections must be clear.  

Devices such as paragraphing, headings, indentation, and enumeration
help the reader see the major points that you want to make.

As a rule of thumb, if you type a full page (double spaced) without
starting a new paragraph, you almost certainly have run one thought
into another and have missed an opportunity to differentiate your ideas.

---

Any tables and figures included in the manuscript must be mentioned (labeled and
referenced) within the main text. Tables and figures should have a purpose; they
should contribute to and be integrated with the rest of the text.

If journal/instructions do not specify otherwise, tables and figures should be
placed near (ideally after) the related text, and on the top of the page. 

Use consistent notation throughout the manuscript, avoid defining any 
unnecessary notation, and avoid using the same notation to describe different
things (variables, indices, etc.).  

## General Tips: Tone and Target Audience

The tone of one's statistical writing needs to be appropriate for its target audience and venue.

The target audience for your paper this semester should be 'upper-level 
(junior or senior) undergraduate statistics students'.

The tone of the writing should be *professional*. It should not be
conversational and should not include slang. 

Use proper English in terms of grammar, capitalization, and punctuation.

## General Tips: Use of English

It is easy to read and understand English which is well written. 

As the quality of writing deteriorates, however, it becomes
progressively more difficult for the reader to understand the author's intended
meaning. 

An obvious, and
easily corrected, problem occurs when the author fails to use properly
constructed sentences. (A good check is to identify the verb in each sentence.)

A much more dangerous (and very frequent) problem occurs when the author
unconsciously assumes that the reader is able to follow his/her unwritten train of thought.

Thus the reader is presumed to know exactly what the author is
talking about -- e.g., what variables are currently being considered,
what is being held fixed, and what is being allowed to vary -- when none of this has ever been stated.

More tips on the use of English: Construction of sentences

+ Target one idea per sentence. 

+ Use your current topic, i.e., what you are writing about, at the beginning of 
the sentence:

&nbsp;Â Â 

> For example, should you write "The preprocessor sorts the
two arrays" or "The two arrays are sorted by the preprocessor"? If you are
discussing the preprocessor, the first sentence is the better option. In
contrast, if you are discussing the arrays, the second sentence is better. If you
are unsure what you are discussing, consider the surrounding sentences: Are they
about the preprocessor or the two arrays?

---

+ Unless instructions or journals say otherwise, it is okay to use 'I' and 'we'. 

+ Be concise: replace long phrases with shorter phrases or eliminate words 
without loss of clarity or accuracy.

+ Subject-verb agreement: if the subject is singular, the verb must also be singular; if the subject is plural, the verb must also be plural. 

+ Common mistake of above: The word 'data' is often mistakenly treated as if it
were a singular noun instead of as a plural noun.  The word 'data' is, in fact, 
a plural noun (singular form is 'datum'). E.g., use 'The data are' instead of
'The data is'.

+ Avoid ending sentences with a preposition; rephrase as needed.  E.g., Use 
'This is something on which we must focus our attention.' or 'We must focus our
attention on this' instead of 'This is something we must focus our attention 
on.' 

---

More tips on the use of English: Use of tenses

&nbsp;Â Â 

> Use the past tense to report what happened in the past: what you did, what
someone reported, what happened in an experiment, and so on. 

> Use the present tense to express general truths, such as conclusions (drawn by
you or by others) and atemporal facts (including information about what the
paper does or covers). 

> Reserve the future tense for perspectives: what you will do in the coming
months or years. 

>Typically, most of your sentences will be in the past tense, some will be in 
the present tense, and very few, if any, will be in the future tense.

---

More tips on the use of English: Use of acronyms


+ Introduce acronyms systematically the first time they are used in a document.

+ First write the full expression, then provide the acronym in parentheses using
  uppercase letters. E.g., ``We prepared Gold NanoParticles (GNP) by ...'' 
  
+ If an acronym is used in both the abstract and the main paper, introduce
 the acronym twice: in the abstract and its first instance in the main paper.
 
--- 

More tips on the use of English: Use of capitalization

Use initial capital letters

+ at beginnings: the start of a sentence, of a heading, etc.;

+ for proper nouns, including nouns describing groups ('computing statistics' 
vs. 'the Statistics Department');

+ for items identified by their number ('in the next figure' vs 'in Figure 2', 
or 'in the following equation' vs. 'in Equation (4)');

+ for specific words: names of days (Monday) and months (April), adjectives of nationality (Algerian), etc.;

+ when defining acronyms. 

## Caution!

+ Avoid using words that have a statistical meaning unless they are being used
in the statistical sense.

+ E.g., 'significant' (or variations), although its statistical use is currently
being de-emphasized. 

+ Other danger words that also have statistical meaning include 'likelihood',
'odds', 'normal', 'robust'.

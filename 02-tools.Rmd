# Using the Right Tools for Writing

Many people use MS Word when it comes to writing. MS Word and actually the whole
MS Office suite. Not withholding the importance of the invention of MS Office,
it is not the right tool to write statistical papers. Writing a statistical
paper using MS Word would be as interesting as running a statistical data
analysis using MS Excel. Simply put, MS Office is great for office staff to do
routine office tasks. For professional writing, you need to be aware of the
professional tools and invest time to learn them.


The right, high-quality, professional typesetting system is LaTeX. It separates
the appearance of a document from its content. There are many different
professionally looking appearances one can choose or design. Authors can focus
on getting the content right.  The document has `.tex` extension, and can be
edited by your favorite editor. The final output of the document can have
different formats, the most popular of which is `pdf`, which stands for portable
document format. It can be opened on any platform (computer operating system).


The source `.tex` file is a plain text file. Just like source code of any
programming language, a plain text file allows version control, which makes
tracking and managing the source easy and professional. The most popular version
control tool today is `git`. 


## Git for Version Control

Many tutorials are available in different formats. Here is a [YouTube video
``Git and GitHub for Beginners --- Crash
Course''](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk)
<!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE). -->
The video also covers GitHub, a cloud service for Git. Other similar services
are, for example, [bitbucket](bitbucket.org), [GitLab](gitlab.com). A cloud
service gives you a cloud back up of your work and makes collaboration with
co-workers easy.


Here is a collection of [online Git exersices](https://gitexercises.fracz.com)
that I used for Git training in other courses that I taught.


Tips on using Git:

+ Make frequent small commits instead of rare large commits.
+ Make commit messages informative and meaningful.
+ Name your files/folders by some reasonable convention. 
    - Lower cases are better than upper cases.
    - No blanks in file/folder names.
+ Keep the repo clean by not tracking generated files.
+ Creat a `.gitignore` file for better output from `git status`.
+ Keep the linewidth of sources to under 80.


## LaTeX for Typesetting

Use [Anthony Zeimbekakis' thesis as a template](https://github.com/azeimbekakis/KS-Test-Thesis).

A \LaTeX\ source file has extension name `.tex`. It is a plain text file that can
be edited by any text editor. It can be tracked easily for differences between
any two versions. Different document classes are predefined such as `letter`,
`article`, `report`, and `book`. Customized document classes can be defined once
you know more about \LaTeX. We focus on `article` here.


### A beginner's template

For the product to look like a paper, we need to have title, author, abstract,
sections, and references. Let us start from a very basic template.


Tips on getting started.

+ Keep the preamble minimally necessary.
+ Set up geometry with the `geometry` package.
+ No manually controlling spaces.
+ Read the [\LaTeX\ symbol
  tables](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/LaTeX:Symbols)
  frequently.


### Math equations

For serious math typesetting, use packages `amsmath`, `amsthm`, and others.


### Tables

If you are manually typing a \LaTeX\ table source, think if you can generate the
source. There are multiple R packages that can generate the tex source from a
given dataset. See package `xtable` for example.

### Figures

Use vector graphs, not raster graphs (unless you have to, e.g.,
screenshots). Save the code that generates the figures so the figures can be
improved easily.

### References

Combination of bibtex and latex to generate the reference list. Non-referenced
references are not to be cited. All referenced references are to be listed.


### Cross-referencing

Define a label for each object and refer to it by its label.

# Using the Right Tools for Writing

Many people use MS Word when it comes to writing. MS Word and actually the whole
MS Office suite Not withholding the importance
of the invention of MS Office, it is not the right tool to write statistical
papers. Writing a statistical paper using MS Word would be as interesting as
running a statistical data analysis using MS Excel. Simply put, MS Office is
great for office staff to do routine office tasks. For professional writing, you
need to be aware of the professional tools and invest time to learn them.


The right, high-quality, professional typesetting system is LaTeX. It separates
the appearance of a document from its content. There are many different
professionally looking appearances one can choose or design. Authors can focus
on getting the content right.  The document has `.tex` extension, and can be
edited by your favorite editor. The final output of the document can have
different formats, the most popular of which is `pdf`, which stands for portable
document format. It can be opened on any platform (computer operating system).


The source `.tex` file is a plain text file. Just like source code of any
programming language, a plain text file allows version control, which makes
tracking and managing the source easy and professional. The most popular version
control tool today is `git`. 


## Git for Version Control

Many tutorials are available in different formats. Here is a [YouTube video
``Git and GitHub for Beginners --- Crash
Course''](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk)
<!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE). -->
The video also covers GitHub, a cloud service for Git. Other similar services
are, for example, [bitbucket](bitbucket.org), [GitLab](gitlab.com). A cloud
service gives you a cloud back up of your work and makes collaboration with
co-workers easy.


Here is a collection of [online Git exersices](https://gitexercises.fracz.com)
that I used for Git training in other courses that I taught.


Tips on using Git:

+ Make frequent small commits instead of rare large commits.
+ Make commit messages informative and meaningful.
+ Name your files/folders by some reasonable convention. Lower cases are better
  than upper cases.
+ Keep the repo clean by not tracking generated files.
+ Creat a `.gitignore` file for better output from `git status`.

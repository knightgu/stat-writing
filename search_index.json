As all scientific papers, it should have some commonly expected structures which include components such as title, abstract, keywords, introduction, methods, results, discussion, acknowledgements, references, appendix, and supplement. Due to the specificity of the statistical discipline and application areas, however, statistical papers could look quite different one from another. There are different types of statistical papers. A theory paper would look similar to a paper in mathematics, with statement of the problem, presentation of some theorems, and technical proofs. Such papers are not covered by here. We focus on two types of statistical papers: application papers and method papers. Application papers focus on a specific application problem in a certain domain where the research discoveries depend on applications of existing or novel statistical methods. Method papers, on the other hand, aim to provide a general methodological solution to a class of applied problems. Often times, methods paper have a theoretical component, for example, the establishment of the asymptotic properties of a new estimator. An applied paper in statistics could be a method paper in the domain of the problem it solves. An author should always keep the target audience in mind when writing. There are many statistical journals on the wide spectrum for applied to theoretical papers. Each one has its own aims and scope, with different target readerships. Writings such as customary statistical reports that are not intended for journal publications also have target readerships. Regardless of the audience, any scientific paper should be convincing and concise. You need to show the readers that your work is important, valid, and useful. You don’t want to waste the time of any readers. 2.1 Applied papers An applied paper has a widely accepted structure: Introduction Data description Methods Results Discussion An applied paper can be applying existing statistical methods to solve an applied problem. See, for example, Price and Yan (2021); Caplan et al. (2019). When sensitivity analysis is desired for the applications, one can have a section on simulation studies. See, for example, J. Jiao et al. (2022); Li et al. (2021). Some applied papers can involve novel methodology development that is motivated by an applied problem. In such cases, simulation studies become necessary, where you validate your methods with simulated data so you can check your estimator with the truth. Such check is not feasible when analyzing real data. See, for example, Jieying Jiao, Hu, and Yan (2021); Hu et al. (2021). 2.2 Methods papers A methods paper focuses on a novel method that is applicable to a general class of problems arising in different domains. A commonly seen structure is: Introduction Methods (e.g., estimation, hypothesis tests, diagnosis) Properties Simulations Illustrations (with real applications) Discussion/Conclusions. The simulations section is often needed for methods papers. Any method has assumptions. Any reasonably good method should work as expected when the assumptions hold. It would be even better if it remains working when some of the assumptions are violated. Simulation studies can be designed to check whether the proposed estimators are unbiased and more efficient than competing estimators; whether the proposed tests retains their sizes and are more powerful than competing tests. Here are some examples: Li et al. (2022+); Lau and Yan (2022).

Not withholding the importance of the invention of MS Office, it is not the right tool to write statistical papers. Writing a statistical paper using MS Word would be as interesting as running a statistical data analysis using MS Excel. Simply put, MS Office is great for office staff to do routine office documentary tasks. For professional writing, one need to be aware of the professional tools and invest time to master them. The right, high-quality, professional typesetting system is LaTeX. It separates the appearance of a document from its content. There are many different professionally looking appearances one can choose or design. Authors can focus on getting the content right. The document has .tex extension, and can be edited by your favorite editor. The final output of the document can have different formats, the most popular of which is pdf, which stands for portable document format. It can be opened on any platform (computer operating system). The source .tex file is a plain text file. Just like source code of any programming language, a plain text file allows version control, which makes tracking and managing the source easy and professional. The most popular version control tool today is git. 3.1 Git for Version Control Many tutorials are available in different formats. Here is a YouTube video ``Git and GitHub for Beginners — Crash Course’’ The video also covers GitHub, a cloud service for Git. Other similar services are, for example, bitbucket, GitLab. A cloud service gives you a cloud back up of your work and makes collaboration with co-workers easy. Here is a collection of online Git exersices that I used for Git training in other courses that I taught. Tips on using Git: Use the command line interface instead of the web interface (e.g., upload on GitHub) Make frequent small commits instead of rare large commits. Make commit messages informative and meaningful. Name your files/folders by some reasonable convention. Lower cases are better than upper cases. No blanks in file/folder names. Keep the repo clean by not tracking generated files. Creat a .gitignore file for better output from git status. Keep the linewidth of sources to under 80 for better git diff view. 3.2 LaTeX for Typesetting Use Anthony Zeimbekakis’ thesis as a template. A LaTeX source file has extension name .tex. It is a plain text file that can be edited by any text editor. It can be tracked easily for differences between any two versions. Different document classes are predefined such as letter, article, report, and book. Customized document classes can be defined once you know more about . We focus on article here. The instructions in this section are practiced in a demo repo. 3.2.1 A beginner’s template For the product to look like a paper, we need to have title, author, abstract, sections, and references. Let us start from a very basic template. Tips on getting started with LaTeX. Read the compiling log and fix the errors/warnings. Google the error/warning messages usually helps. Keep the preamble minimally necessary. Set up geometry with the geometry package. No manually controlling spaces. Read the LaTeX symbol tables frequently. Keep line widths under 80 characters. Separate paragraphs by double blank likes. 3.2.2 Math equations For serious math typesetting, use packages amsmath, amsthm, and others. Tips on using math: Punctuate equations as they always are part of sentences. Add spaces between symbols for better readability in sources. No starting a sentence with a math symbol; rephrase to avoid it. No fractions (\\frac) inline math. No breaking inline maths into different lines in tex sources. No labeling equations that are not referenced to. Keep fonts consistent for the same notations (e.g., \\(n\\) not n; AIC not \\(AIC\\)). Use appropriate sizes for parenthesis. Use predefined math functions (e.g, \\(\\exp\\) not \\(exp\\); \\(\\Pr\\) not \\(P\\)). Use \\allowdisplaybreak to allow page breaks in aligned equations. Referencing with \\eqref instead of (\\ref). Use \\dd for differentiation orperator (available from package physics). No breaking long equations arbitrarily in tex source; use short lines and add sufficient spaces to make the sources more readable. Align at appropriate places in multiline equations. 3.2.3 Tables If you are manually typing a LaTeX table source, think if you can generate the source. There are multiple R packages that can generate the tex source from a given dataset. See package xtable for example. Tips on professional LaTeX tables: Use tbp for floating locations; avoid h. Make it self-contained with an informative caption. Avoid vertical lines. Put negative signs in math mode. Use better top, middle, and bottom rules from package booktabs. Allow hierarchy by cmidrule(). Do not change font size for tables. Change table layout to fit instead of re-sizing it. Right adjust numbers with decimal places. See Small Guide to Making Nice Tables by Markus P\"u{}schel 3.2.4 Figures Use vector graphs, not raster graphs (unless you have to, e.g., screenshots). Save the code that generates the figures so the figures can be improved easily. Tipis on LaTeX figures: Use tbp for floating locations; avoid h. Use latex package graphicx. For line plots with different groups, use different line pattern to distinguish them, not only color, so that readers can tell the difference when printing them out. Same for different dots on plots. Use colorblind friendly colors (especially avoid red/green) Keep the right aspect ratio when necessary (e.g., basketball court; map; pp-plot). Remove extra margins. Keep the ratio when resizing (e.g., width = \\textwidth) Name the figure files appropriately. 3.2.5 References Combination of BibTeX and LaTeX to generate the reference list. Non-referenced references are not to be cited. All referenced references are to be listed. The nice feature is made possible by the package natbib. We need to collect references in BibTeX format and same them in a bib database (.bib) file. The display styles of the references are controlled by bib style (.bst) files. Many journals have their own bib style files for downloading. One can construct a customized bib style easily with the help of custom-bib. A reference is cited in the manuscript through their keys by \\citep{} for parenthetical citations or \\citet{} for textual citations. Variations \\citep*{} and \\citet*{} prints all authors. Sometimes, \\citeauthor{} and \\citeyear{} can be useful when only author(s) or year is needed. The key of the cited references is put in the parentheses. For \\citep{}, multiple keys can be put in the same parentheses for citing multiple references. Two optional arguments are allowed to \\citep[][]{}. For example, \\citep[see, e.g.,][p. 26]{} could be useful when a specific page (or section/chapter) is being referenced as an example, In general, to compile a tex file with bibtex references into a pdf document, one needs to run pdflatex first, then bibtex, and then pdflatex twice to get the references correct. A simpler solution is latexmk -pdf. In my practice, I always have a Makefile and use make to smartly automate the compiling process. See, for example, Anthony’s thesis repo. Tips on preparing BibTeX databases: Devise a good naming convention for references keys and stick to it. Keep the bib database sorted and formatted tidy. (No repeated entries.) Title: Capitalize initials of notional words (not form words). Use Google Scholar to get the bibtex source of a reference, but be sure to quality control the google output for missing fields and errors. Protect capitalization of words with special meanings in curly braces. (e.g., {B}ayesian, {M}arkov Chain {M}onte {C}arlo) Protect captilization of initial words after a colon in titles. Book needs to have publisher and address fields. For preprints, always check if they have been published recently. Use the note field to show information that should always be shown, Double hyphen between pages numbers. All references without page numbers or volume number should be checked. 3.2.6 Cross-referencing Define a label for each object and refer to it by its label. Tips on cross-referencing: Devise a good naming convention for labels and stick to it. Use different labels for different types of objects (e.g, eq: for equations sec: for sections, tab: for tables, fig: for figures, alg: for algorithms, etc.) Watch warnings from compiling logs for undefined labels or multiply defined labels and fix them. Use package xr for cross-document referencing. 3.3 Using R Markdown as a Frontend Here is a template from the UConn Data Science Lab. "],["getting-started.html", "Chapter 4 Getting Started 4.1 Full Cycle of a Statistical Research Project 4.2 Writing a Research Proposal", " Chapter 4 Getting Started 4.1 Full Cycle of a Statistical Research Project Like any research project, a statistical research project starts with an interesting idea, goes through a full cycle of brainstorming, planning with the right design/methods, investigation with the simulation studies/data analyses, iteration as nesessary, and summarizing through writing/revision. Find a topic of interest. The topic should interests you, something about which you already know something about or can find out more. The topic should also be something that is within your capacity restricted by your skillsets and time. Check the literature to see what works have been available on it or related topics. In short, the topic should be reasonably interesting and doable. You can get ideas for research by attending siminars; reading journals, books, magazines, and newspapers; consulting; collaboration. Initial planning. After you have identified an topic, you need to narrow down on the specific research questions that you want to answer, what data will be used, and what methods are appropriate. Form a hypothesis, design a study, conduct the study, make notes. Collect data and find some existing data. Decide on appropriate statistical methods. Make a tentative outline to guide writing. Statistical investigation. Perform data analysis. Summarize substantive findings. Investigate the performance of proposed methods via simulations. Iterate between planning and investigation. Revise and proofread. Revising and writing are two separate processes. Check organization — reorganize paragraphs and add transitions where necessary. Make sure all researched information is documented (reproducibility). Rework introduction and conclusion. Work on sentences — check spelling, punctuation, word choice, etc. Read out loud to check for flow. Find a friend to review. 4.2 Writing a Research Proposal A research proposal is piece of writing that details exactly what you plan to do in a research project. The following components are expected in your proposal. Introduction: Introducing the topic and why you have chosen this topic (3–5 lines). Mention briefly the current related research and cite relevant works. Specific aims: Formulate a research question or hypothesis in the chosen topic. Describe briefly why you select such a question or hypothesis and its importance in the field (cite sources). Data description: Describe your data set (for instance: sampling scheme, number of observations, number of variables, variables of interest, nature of the variables) and the source of your data set if it is not collected by yourself. Research design/methods/schedule: Describe briefly (5-7 lines) your plan of action. If you choose to apply any specific statistical methods, please mention and cite them. Please be consistent here with your research hypothesis. Write a line regarding how the methods would help in investigating the research hypothesis. Discussion: What do you expect to find and why do you feel so? Any ways your work can corroborate or challenge existing results or assumptions? What are the potential impacts of your work? What if the investigation is not what you expect? Conclusion: Wrap it up by briefly summarizing your research proposal and reinforces your research’s stated purpose. "],["writing-specific-sections.html", "Chapter 5 Writing Specific Sections 5.1 Title 5.2 Abstract 5.3 Keywords 5.4 Introduction 5.5 Data 5.6 Methods 5.7 Simulation 5.8 Application 5.9 Discussion 5.10 Appendix 5.11 References 5.12 Online Supplement", " Chapter 5 Writing Specific Sections 5.1 Title Title is the most read part of an article. Hairston and Keene (2003) suggest that the title of a research paper should accomplish four goals: predict the content of the research paper; be interesting to the reader; reflect the tone of the writing; contain important keywords (that makes it easier to be found from keywords search). The title of a paper is usually determined when the paper is close to completion. To come up with a good title, list some key phrases that you would like to have, and be creative in forming a good title consisting most of them. Here are some tipcs. Be informative by including these aspects: topic, method(s), data, and results. Consider adding a subtitle to give more specifics about the paper. Use appropriate critical keywords to increase the discoverability of the paper. Follow the requirements from the instructions or journals. Keep it as concise as possible. 5.2 Abstract Marron (1999) recommended the following: Abstract material needs to be carefully chosen. A balance between the twin goals of brevity and maximal information content should again be carefully sought. There is room for more detail than in the title, but not enough room for all ideas covered in the paper. Make sure each ``high point” is included. The paper will have a better chance in the review process if it is made clear what is done, and why it is important, since this will immediately capture the interest of the reviewer. Any recommendations for length here must be more case dependent. Longer papers will usually need longer abstracts. However, something between 4 and 10 sentences is reasonable for most situations. Mathematical notation is rarely useful in the abstract. Sometimes notation is introduced in an abstract, and then not used at all! Even when notation is used in the abstract, the point can usually be conveyed more efficienly in words alone. Tips: An opening sentence to establish the importance of the subject of the paper. Identify a gap in the literature to set up the background of the paper. Highlight the novelty/contributions of the paper. For application papers, allude to new discoveries and their impacts. For method papers, outline the essence of the methodology, evidence from numerical studies supporting the methods. 5.3 Keywords Keywords are words in addition to those in the title that attract search queries. Including the most relevant keywords helps other researchers find your paper. No need to repeat anything in the title already. List them in alphabetical order. Contain words and phrases that suggest what the topic is about. 5.4 Introduction The introduction section is always the first section of a paper. Some journals may not call it introduction but requires a section that serves the same purposes. The introduction section guide the readers from a general subject area to the narrow topic of the paper. It should answer three questions: Why does it matter? What have been done? What are new? That is, the introduction sections need to explain the impotance of the topic of the paper, provide the background of the research work, and highlight the contributions of the work. At the end of the introduction, a roadmap, or an outline of the paper is useful in helping the readers navigating through the following sections. An introduction often contain the following items. An overview of the topic. Start with a general overview of your topic and narrow it to the specific subject you are addressing. Then, mention questions or concerns you had about the case. Explain why they are important and needs to be addressed right now. Existing works. Introduction is the place to review other conclusions on your topic. The literature review should be thorough, including both old and recent ones. It should you that you are aware of prior research. It also introduces past findings to those who might not have that expertise. A gap need to be identified from the importance of the topic and the current status of the literature, which is the rationale for your work. Contributions. This is a thesis statement, which summarizes the the contributions of your work to the existing literature, and answer the “what are new” question. A roadmap. A brief summary of what each section does in the paper concludes the introduction. 5.5 Data The data section should provide all the details that are relevant for the research project. Who collected the data (source)? How was the data collected? Sampling frame? Sampling approach? What period or range does the data cover? Why does the data helps answer the research question? What exploratory analyses are done (descriptives, visualication, etc.)? 5.6 Methods Notations are much easier to digest if the reader first understands the main idea at an intuitive level. What are the observed data? What are the models? What are the parameters to be estimated? How are the point estimators obtained? How are the uncertainty (standard errors) of the point estimators assessed? How are the variance of the point estimator estimated? How are the null distribution of the testing statistics established? Clearly state the assumptions and claims of theoretical results. 5.7 Simulation ADEMP (Morris, White, and Crowther 2019): Aims Data generating mechanism Estimand/target of analysis Methods Performance measures Coding and Execution Analysis/Discussion: with tables and figures. For each table/figure, write down the bullet points to convey to the readers. Group the bulletin points in blocks and put the blocks in a logical order. Within each block, put the bullet points in the right logical order. 5.8 Application Report the statistical analyses in tables/figures. When summarizing from tables/figures, paint the big picture, rather than reiterating all of the little details. Discussions to link the analyses back to the substantive topic (Miller 2015): Having presented the individual pieces of evidence, an investigator must summarize how that evidence, taken together, support the conclusoin of the investigation. Statisticians should explain how the statistical evidence answers the question posed at the beginning of the paper, following standard expository writing guidelines to writing an analytic essay. 5.9 Discussion A summary, again, of the contributions of the research. Limitations of the current study Future directions. 5.10 Appendix Technical details (e.g., proofs, algorithms) that would otherwise break the flow of the main text. Data source details. 5.11 References Every reference cited in the paper should appear here. References not cited should not appear here. All are automatically taken care of by BibTeX.

As all scientific papers, it should have some commonly expected structures which include components such as title, abstract, keywords, introduction, methods, results, discussion, acknowledgements, references, appendix, and supplement. Due to the specificity of the statistical discipline and application areas, however, statistical papers could look quite different one from another. There are different types of statistical papers. A theory paper would look similar to a paper in mathematics, with statement of the problem, presentation of some theorems, and technical proofs. Such papers are not covered by here. We focus on two types of statistical papers: application papers and method papers. Application papers focus on a specific application problem in a certain domain where the research discoveries depend on applications of existing or novel statistical methods. Method papers, on the other hand, aim to provide a general methodological solution to a class of applied problems. Often times, methods paper have a theoretical component, for example, the establishment of the asymptotic properties of a new estimator. An applied paper in statistics could be a method paper in the domain of the problem it solves. An author should always keep the target audience in mind when writing. There are many statistical journals on the wide spectrum for applied to theoretical papers. Each one has its own aims and scope, with different target readerships. Writings such as customary statistical reports that are not intended for journal publications also have target readerships. Regardless of the audience, any scientific paper should be convincing and concise. You need to show the readers that your work is important, valid, and useful. You don’t want to waste the time of any readers. 2.1 Applied papers An applied paper has a widely accepted structure: Introduction Data description Methods Results Discussion An applied paper can be applying existing statistical methods to solve an applied problem. See, for example, Price and Yan (2021); Caplan et al. (2019). When sensitivity analysis is desired for the applications, one can have a section on simulation studies. See, for example, J. Jiao et al. (2022); Li et al. (2021). Some applied papers can involve novel methodology development that is motivated by an applied problem. In such cases, simulation studies become necessary, where you validate your methods with simulated data so you can check your estimator with the truth. Such check is not feasible when analyzing real data. See, for example, Jieying Jiao, Hu, and Yan (2021); Hu et al. (2021). 2.2 Methods papers A methods paper focuses on a novel method that is applicable to a general class of problems arising in different domains. A commonly seen structure is: Introduction Methods (e.g., estimation, hypothesis tests, diagnosis) Properties Simulations Illustrations (with real applications) Discussion/Conclusions. The simulations section is often needed for methods papers. Any method has assumptions. Any reasonably good method should work as expected when the assumptions hold. It would be even better if it remains working when some of the assumptions are violated. Simulation studies can be designed to check whether the proposed estimators are unbiased and more efficient than competing estimators; whether the proposed tests retains their sizes and are more powerful than competing tests. Here are some examples: Li et al. (2022+); Lau and Yan (2022).

MS Word and actually the whole MS Office suite. Not withholding the importance of the invention of MS Office, it is not the right tool to write statistical papers. Writing a statistical paper using MS Word would be as interesting as running a statistical data analysis using MS Excel. Simply put, MS Office is great for office staff to do routine office tasks. For professional writing, you need to be aware of the professional tools and invest time to learn them. The right, high-quality, professional typesetting system is LaTeX. It separates the appearance of a document from its content. There are many different professionally looking appearances one can choose or design. Authors can focus on getting the content right. The document has .tex extension, and can be edited by your favorite editor. The final output of the document can have different formats, the most popular of which is pdf, which stands for portable document format. It can be opened on any platform (computer operating system). The source .tex file is a plain text file. Just like source code of any programming language, a plain text file allows version control, which makes tracking and managing the source easy and professional. The most popular version control tool today is git. 3.1 Git for Version Control Many tutorials are available in different formats. Here is a YouTube video ``Git and GitHub for Beginners — Crash Course’’ The video also covers GitHub, a cloud service for Git. Other similar services are, for example, bitbucket, GitLab. A cloud service gives you a cloud back up of your work and makes collaboration with co-workers easy. Here is a collection of online Git exersices that I used for Git training in other courses that I taught. Tips on using Git: Make frequent small commits instead of rare large commits. Make commit messages informative and meaningful. Name your files/folders by some reasonable convention. Lower cases are better than upper cases. Keep the repo clean by not tracking generated files. Creat a .gitignore file for better output from git status. 3.2 LaTeX for Typesetting Use Anthony Zeimbekakis’ thesis as a template. 3.2.1 Use R Markdown as a Frontend Here is a template from the UConn Data Science Lab.
